Description: Utility/library for checking connectivity between services
 conn-check allows for checking connectivity with external services.
 You can write a config file that defines services that you need to
 have access to, and conn-check will check connectivity with each.
 It supports various types of services, all of which allow for
 basic network checks, but some allow for confirming that
 credentials also work.
