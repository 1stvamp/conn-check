 conn-check
 ==========
 .
 conn-check allows for checking connectivity with external services.
 .
 You can write a config file that defines services that you need to
 have access to, and conn-check will check connectivity with each.
 .
 It supports various types of services, all of which allow for
 basic network checks, but some allow for confirming credentials
 work also.
